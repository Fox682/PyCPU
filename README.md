# PyCPU
Python Script to run an Assembly like language

==================================

## PyCPU
- Runs Assembly like language 
- cpu.py is the actual CPU
- compile.py is the Compiler
- infile2 <-- Input | Output --> outfile2 (adjust accordingly)

To Use:
- Use a Text Editor to write down Assembly Instructions
- Run compile.py - Compiles instructions into Byte-based NOT Binary based file
- Run cpu.py - Runs the Command from compiled file. Script will look for file generated by compile.py

Current Progress: (for both "AX" & "BX" Registers)
- Math - ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV
- INC & DEC
- CMP >,< & == (Sets Flags)
- JMP (Relative), JE (Equal), JL (Less-Than), JG (Greater Than)
- LD (Load Immediate)

"infile2" includes more instructions on how to use the cpu.py.

Planned:
- Both scripts need cleaned up to input files specified... or leave them. 
- CMP Flags are odd... will fix (Low Priority as it works currently)
- MOV Instruction
- 2 more Registers
- Screen Output
- Networking

Future:
- Optimize
- Possible Bitwise Version

Note:
The cpu is a emulator of sorts, it is not meant to be fast in any sence of the word. 
It is however a good intro for programming in assembly (when fleshed out).

Future use case (Goal!):
- Research into Minimalistic VMs with Networking 
- Custom Protocol Examination
- Simulated Multiple CPU Cooperation
