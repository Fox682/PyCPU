# PyCPU
Python Script to run an Assembly like language

==================================
PyCPU
- Runs Assembly like language 
- cpu.py is the actual CPU
- compile.py is the Compiler


To Use:
- Use a Text Editor to write down Assembly Instructions
- Run compile.py
- Run cpu.py - Script will look for file generated by compile.py

Current Progress:
- ADD
- SUB
- MUL
- DIV
- INC
- DEC
- JMP (relative)
- LD (Load Immediate)
- NOP (No Operation)

Planned:
- Both scripts need cleaned up to input files specified... or leave them
- CMP
- MOV
- Screen Output
- Networking
- Optimize
- Possible Bitwise Version

Note:
The cpu is a emulator of sorts, it is not meant to be fast in any sence of the word. 
It is however a good intro for programming in assembly (when fleshed out).

Future use case:
- Research into Minimalistic VMs with Networking
- Potential for Custom Protocol Examination

Disclaimer:
- Not fit for any use whatsoever, do not use in production.
- Any Suggestions or feedback appreciated, don't expect a reply in any reasonable amount of time
