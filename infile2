ld ax,1
ld bx,1
inc ax
inc bx
jmp -3,0
0


######
Notes: - put notes after '0'

- CPU and Compiler will stop at '0'
- JMP MUST include  ",0" (Bug) or it will not compile
- NOP must also include 0,0 (Bug) or it will not compile

How JMP instruction is calculated

1- inc ax,0   	- 1st <- jmps here-#3
2- inc bx,0   	- 2nd <------------#2
3 - jmp -3,0  	- 3rd <- counts as #1
nop 0,0			- 0,0 for No-OP doesn't do anything but prevent Compiler Errors
0				- Halts CPU & Compiler!
